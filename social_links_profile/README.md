## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I wanted to use this challenge to build up my React knowledge and how to start projects.

As this is a straightforward Grid css styling. Furthermore, whilst I used mobile-first css workflow, the final media query is one line as the scaling was pretty consistent from the beginning. I think this works for a simple card, maybe something to explore with large more interactive applications.

All in all, I happy with using Vite and React in this project to help build my knowledge further.

### Continued development

Hopefully in the next challenge, I will look act building my interactive knowledge which is one my weaker areas with React.
