## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I wanted to use this challenge to build upon my basics of React and look into components.

Each section after the header was broken into a separate component. This was then followed up with basic CSS styling.

### Continued development

I also experimented with going desktop-first rather than mobile first. This extended the time taken to complete and actually mad eit difficult to adjust features in mobile. Next time, I would focus on mobile first and maybe using pure html and css without a library.
